# ArcGIS_Arcade
A series of snippets, attribute rules, and other building blocks for commonly used functions within Arcade

Arcade is Javascript-esque, so these files are saved with a .js for formatting purposes within GitHub. Within the ArcGIS Pro software, these expressions can be copy-pasted into the expression area for calculate fields, symbology, and attribute rules. From there they can be exported into corresponding file formats for their function (.cal, .lxp, .csv)
